This project has examined perceived fake news on Reddit, specifically looking at the differences between topics. Though this project had its challenges, specifically with the overwhelming amount of reddit data we collected, we were able to find some interesting results. Below we have included graph 3.1 which shows the topic breakdown and 3.2 which shows the misinformation counts for each topic.
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false 
topics = pd.read_csv('../data/csv/topic_counts.csv')
fig = px.pie(topics, values='count', names='topic')
fig.show()
```


```{python}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false 
topic_misinfo_true = pd.read_csv('../data/csv/topic_misinfo_true_count.csv')
fig = px.bar(topic_misinfo_true, x='topic', y='count')
fig.show()
```
