We will then group by the new day variable and count the group by data. We will create a bar graph of the counts to visualize the findings. This will be conducted for both comments and submissions.\n\n\n \n\n Business Goal - 2 : Determine the frequency of fake news identifiers.\n\nTechnical proposal : We will extract the year from the DateTime variable. Using this, we will group by year and count the grouped data. We will visualize our findings in a table that includes comments and submissions.\n\n\n \n\n Business Goal - 3 : Determine which fake news identifier is used the most. \n\nTechnical Proposal : First, we will utilize regex to match on different fake news identifiers like bullshit, propaganda, or fake news. Using this, we will create a fake news indicator column that shows if the phrase was present in the comment. Then, we will group by the indicator column and count the groups. We will visualize our findings in a table.\n\n\n \n\nBusiness Goal - 4 : Who are those most active accounts in these news subreddits? \n\nTechnical Proposal : To determine the most active accounts in the news subreddits, we will identify the top 10 users with the highest number of posts. We will extract the usernames from the dataset and group by each user to count their posts. Then, we will compare the number of posts made by these top users in both subreddits. Finally, we will present the findings in a bar chart.\n\n\n \n\nBusiness Goal - 5 : Determine the frequency and the accumulated scores of news sources. \n\nTechnical Proposal:  In this analysis, our objective is to comprehend the frequency and cumulative scores associated with different news sources. Initially, we’ll extract the “domain” information from the URL of each post. Subsequently, we’ll aggregate the data based on these sources, computing both the frequency of posts and summarizing the scores attributed to each source.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBusiness Goal - 6 : Determine the news topics that are interacted with the most.  Among all types of news, which category do people concern about the most? Is it related to war, disaster, food crisis or something else? \n\nTechnical Proposal: Use topic modeling to create different broad news categories. Group by those categories and analyze the comments.\n\n\n \n\nBusiness Goal - 7 :  Determine what topics are perceived as fake news. \n\nTechnical Proposal : Use topic modeling created above. Perform sentiment analysis on the comments. Comments with negative sentiment and containing misinformation identifiers will be misinformation. Topics with more of these comments will be perceived as fake news.\n\n\n \n\nBusiness Goal - 8 :  Find this difference in perceived misinformation from 2021 (post-election year) to 2023 (pre-election year). \n\nTechnical Proposal : We will use the combined sentiment analysis and misinformation indicator to identify comments with negative sentiment and contain a misinformation indicator. We will group by this new variable and count the grouped data. Since there are significantly fewer comments in 2023, we will then take the rate of misinformation comments to compare the two.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBusiness Goal - 8 :  Which articles might be perceived as misinformation, or labeled by users as fake news? \n\nTechnical Proposal : We will employ a supervised machine learning model to predict articles that are prone to be perceived as misinformation. Specifically, we’ll utilize techniques such as decision trees to discern which features contribute significantly to the classification process. By analyzing various attributes of article titles, we’ll determine patterns indicating potential fake news. This comprehensive approach will shed light on both the types of titles more likely to be labeled as fake news and the key features crucial for classification accuracy.\n\n\n \n\nBusiness Goal - 9 :  Which articles might be perceived as misinformation, or labeled by users as fake news? \n\nTechnical Proposal : We will employ a supervised machine learning model to predict articles that are prone to be perceived as misinformation.

    "text": "Analyzing Weekly Activity Trends\nIn this section, we delve into understanding the patterns of user engagement on Reddit. We begin by examining the distribution of activity across different days of the week, extracted from the DateTime variable. By grouping the data based on these days, we quantify the frequency of user interactions, both in terms of comments and submissions. The insights derived from this analysis are visually represented through a bar graph in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n Figure 2.1: Number of submissions per day of the week from 2021-2023   As shown in Figure 2.1, the trend for submissions exhibits a significant dip during the weekends. This suggests that users are less likely to initiate new threads or topics on Saturday and Sunday.A potential factor contributing to this weekend slump could be the downtime in news cycles, as journalists and news outlets typically slow down on these days.Interestingly, Thursday is the busiest day for submissions, contrary to the intuitive expectation that Monday would start the week with a surge.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n Figure 2.2: Number of comments per day of the week from 2021-2023   Figure 2.2 depicts a different dynamic for comments, with activity gradually increasing from Monday, reaching a zenith on Thursday. This progressive increase could indicate users’ growing engagement with content as the week unfolds. Despite both submissions and comments peaking on Thursday, only comments display a steady climb throughout the weekdays.  When we synthesize the data from submissions and comments, a compelling narrative about user engagement emerges. Thursday stands out as a pinnacle of activity for Reddit, with both submissions and comments reaching their highest levels. This indicates that Thursdays are not just about new content being created but also about the peak in interactions with existing threads. The pattern across the week shows more engagement with ongoing discussions rather than starting new ones, especially as the week progresses.",

While there is a notable decline in submissions from 2021 to 2023, the number of comments exhibits a contrasting pattern, with a significant increase observed from 2021 to 2022 followed by a decline in 2023. This divergence suggests a potential shift in user behavior towards increased engagement with existing content rather than generating new posts. Further investigation into the underlying factors influencing this trend could provide valuable insights into evolving user preferences and platform dynamics.",

However, a closer inspection reveals that in the past year, approximately 27,000 unique users have made submissions, and around 1.2 million have commented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure 2.4: Top 10 Users Post Comparison for News and World News Subreddits  \n\n\n╒══════════════════════╤════════════════════╕\n│ author               │   submission_count │\n╞══════════════════════╪════════════════════╡\n│ rajacreator          │              68724 │\n│ popularnewsindia     │              30485 │\n│ newsnationglobal     │              17184 │\n│ roknonline           │              15960 │\n│ Som2ny-Official      │              14037 │\n│ The_Dispatch         │              13240 │\n│ First-Situation-1384 │              12811 │\n│ AgeCompetitive4420   │              11398 │\n│ tellygupsgup_redit   │               9747 │\n│ HindustanNewsBharat  │               9550 │\n╘══════════════════════╧════════════════════╛\n\n\n Table 2.4: Top 10 Active User in News Subreddit  \n\n\n╒══════════════════╤════════════════════╕\n│ author           │   submission_count │\n╞══════════════════╪════════════════════╡\n│ harryg888        │              57339 │\n│ theworldnnews    │               5509 │\n│ AdrienSergent    │               5139 │\n│ Infoseven7       │               5107 │\n│ DoremusJessup    │               3999 │\n│ shubhamk1995     │               3532 │\n│ USNEWS01         │               3027 │\n│ Efficient-Ad9226 │               2785 │\n│ radarhitnews     │               2625 │\n│ nkonsontv        │               2577 │\n╘══════════════════╧════════════════════╛\n\n\n Table 2.5: Top 10 Active User in World News Subreddit   The analysis of the two tables indicates a notable prevalence of [deleted] accounts among the top 10 active users in both the “news” and “worldnews” subreddits. Additionally, it reveals a significant disparity in posting frequency between the two categories. Specifically, the top 10 users in the “news” subreddit demonstrate considerably higher posting rates, with counts exceeding 9,000, compared to the “worldnews” subreddit where the counts remain above 2,000. This discrepancy suggests a potential discrepancy in user engagement and interest levels between the two thematic categories, highlighting the diverse participation patterns within the Reddit community across different topics.",

To achieve this, we extract the domain information from each submission’s URL and aggregate the data to evaluate two main metrics: the frequency of posts from each news source and the cumulative karma scores these posts have received.\nThis dual-faceted approach enables us to not only see which news sources are most frequently posted but also which ones resonate the most with the Reddit community, as reflected by their karma scores. The results are encapsulated in two distinct tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure 2.: Top 10 Users Post Comparison for News and World News Subreddits   To visually represent the frequency of posts by these news sources, we created a word cloud, as shown in the uploaded image. This illustration vividly displays the prominence of certain names, with ‘Reuters’ and ‘BBCWorld’ appearing more prominently, indicating a higher frequency of posts from these sources compared to others like ‘rajacreator’ or ‘tellygupshup’.\n\n\n| source       | frequency   | karma_score   |   score rank |\n|--------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Reuters      | 319,453     | 327,004       |           43 |\n| rajacreator  | 68,753      | 68,753        |           45 |\n| AP           | 63,886      | 67,112        |           46 |\n| bluzz        | 57,339      | 57,337        |           47 |\n| reuters      | 39,747      | 34,230,489    |            1 |\n| youtube      | 38,580      | 38,472        |           48 |\n| news         | 34,528      | 13,992,972    |           10 |\n| BBCWorld     | 33,884      | 34,733        |           49 |\n| tellygupshup | 31,600      | 31,596        |           50 |\n| popularnews  | 30,492      | 30,491        |           51 |\n\n\n Table 2.5: Top 10 Sources by Frequency  \nTable 2.5 lists the top 10 sources by the frequency of posts. Reuters takes the lead in the number of posts, with a significant presence on the platform.

    "text": "This project aimed to analyze the comments and posts on the r/worldnews subreddit through natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. In our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identified what news sites were primarily shared on the subreddit, via aggregated submission counts; began seeing what stories were most popular, based on karma scores; found that the discussion threads were heavily tied to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict; and examined the distribution of comments and submissions over time. We noted that several of the shared sites were American in origin, but also saw that many of the popular sources came from several European countries, including Russia. Other social media sites were also a popular submission choice, especially YouTube. Using the ACLED data, we were also able to determine that while the conflict was receiving a large share of attention, not all of the events of the conflict were being shared equally. Additionally, the time series analysis saw that there were multiple gaps in the dataset for certain time periods.\n Table 5.1 : Most Shared News Sites \nIn the NLP stage of our analysis, we chose to look closer at the topics and entities that the submissions were about, as well as examine the sentiment of both the comments and submissions. In our topic modelling we found that using the whole data resulted in groups with substantial amounts of overlap regarding the conflict. We then constrained the data to time periods that saw high amounts of search interest in Google Trends, creating two subsets which included posts and comments that occurred up to two weeks after the designated event’s date. The resulting subsetted data produced clearer topic groups, with specific events being highlighted, although the cluster of groups which were hard to differentiate remained. For the sentiment analysis at this stage, we used pretrained models from JohnSnowLabs to examine both the sentiment of the comments in the threads as well as comments and submission titles related to the Russia-Ukraine Conflict. Of the three different models used, Twitter and IMDB had identical results while the Vivek model registered a larger portion of the comments and submissions as neutral, but all three models indicated negative sentiment as the plurality of sentiments, if not the majority. The live threads’ results indicated strong sentiments, both positive and negative across the comments, a pattern which seemed to hold in the comments of submissions. The article titles, however, demonstrate much greater negativity according to the IMDB and Twitter models, while the Vivek model read it as again having more neutrality.\n Table 5.2 : Pre-Trained Models Sentiment Results on Comments and Submissions \nLastly, we have successfully designed and implemented predictive ML models to predict controversiality markers and the sentiment of comments and submissions. The controversiality model took in a TF-IDF weighted vector of the comments and was able to achieve a high level of predictive strength, although that seemed to be a result, in large part, due to the class imbalance. We believe that the deleted and removed comments were likely controversial, and so the remaining controversial ones were not being predicted as well as we would hope. For the sentiment model we decided to use Vader-Sentiment lexicon to label our data rather than relying exclusively on pretrained models. The dataset we used to classify sentiment appeared to label more similarly to the Vivek model, with the plurality being negative but showing a larger proportion of neutral material. Several ML algorithms were then used to train the labelled dataset and we ultimately saw great success with test error at slightly above 8%.\n Figure 5.1 : ROC Curves for Different Predictive Models Used in Predicting Controversiality \nMoving forward, we feel that we can further improve our models via the use of over and under sampling techniques to deal with the class imbalance. Additionally, we believe that we can improve on a predictive model for karma scores that we attempted, although at present its accuracy can be described only as pitiful.",

    "text": "Assessing Sentiments on Comments\nTo gain further insights into Reddit users’ attitudes toward different topics’ news, we employ sentiment analysis. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is utilized for this purpose. VADER is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool that evaluates the sentiment intensity of text. It operates by utilizing a pre-existing lexicon of words and linguistic rules to generate compound sentiment scores ranging from -1 to 1. Positive scores indicate positive sentiment, negative scores indicate negative sentiment, and scores around 0 denote neutrality.\nTo implement sentiment analysis using VADER, we leverage the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class from the vaderSentiment library. We define a function called vader_sentiment, which accepts text input, computes its VADER score using the polarity_scores method of the analyzer, and returns the compound score.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n Figure 3.3 : Sentiment Intensity Frequency Across Vader Score Ranges \nThe plot shows a declining trend from the interval [-1.0~-0.9] starting at just over 140,000, dropping sharply until the [0.8~-0.7] interval, then more gradually declining through the [0.7~-0.6] and [0.6~-0.5] intervals. There is a slight increase in frequency at the [0.5~-0.4] interval.\nThis distribution suggests that the most common sentiment scores in the analyzed dataset are strongly negative, as indicated by the higher counts in the negative score ranges. The presence of a minor increase in the last interval might suggest a small concentration of sentiments in that particular range as well.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n Figure 3.4 : Comparative Sentiment Distribution in Different News and Entertainment Sectors \nIn Figure 3.4, we presents a set of four pie charts titled “Figure 3.4: Vader Score Distribution,” which illustrate the distribution of sentiment scores within four different categories: US politics, economics/Russia&Ukraine, presidential news, and TV shows. Each pie chart is divided into two segments based on a threshold value of -0.8 on the Vader sentiment scale.\nUS Politics: 60.3% of the sentiment scores are above -0.8, suggesting a more positive sentiment, while 39.7% are below -0.8, indicating a more negative sentiment. Economics/Russia&Ukraine: 61% of scores are above -0.8, and 39% are below -0.8, also showing a predominance of more positive sentiment. Presidential News: 59.4% of the scores are above -0.8, while 40.6% are below -0.8. TV Shows: 58.2% are above -0.8, and 41.8% are below -0.8. The color coding is consistent across all charts, with blue representing scores above -0.8 and pink representing scores below -0.8. In all categories, the majority of sentiments are above -0.8, indicating a leaning towards more positive or neutral sentiments overall. The similarity in the distribution across different categories suggests a possible pattern in the sentiment of the content analyzed, with none of the categories showing an overwhelming negative sentiment.",

The table below shows analysis by topic. We can see that the model was slightly more accurate at predicting perceived misinformation in COVID news and TV shows. It was slightly less accurate at predicting misinformation in current events. The final column shows the ratio of articles incorrectly labeled as containing no misinformation comments over the total number of falsely predicted articles. It basically shows the ratio of false negatives over false positives and false negatives. We can see the ratio is significantly higher for the topics: tv shows, demographic information, and covid. Foreign events and social media have the smallest ratio at about .55.",

    "text": "Clustering\n\nData Preparation\nWe streamlined the data preparation process for machine learning using a Pipeline that includes several stages: StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, VectorAssembler, and Normalizer. This approach efficiently transforms and normalizes the data, ensuring it is ready for subsequent analysis and modeling.\n\n\nChoose clustering methods\nChoose several clustering algorithms to compare. Common choices include K-means, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and spectral clustering. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses.  Table 4.4 : Comparison of Clustering Methods  | Clustering Method | Suitability for Data Types | Pros | Cons | |——————–|—————————-|——|——| | K-means | Numerical data, well-separated clusters, clusters with similar sizes | - Simple and easy to implement- Scales well to large datasets- Works well with spherical clusters | - Assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized- Sensitive to outliers- Requires predefined number of clusters | | Hierarchical Clustering | Any data type, small to medium-sized datasets, clusters with irregular shapes | - No need to specify the number of clusters- Can handle clusters of different sizes and shapes- Provides a dendrogram for visualization | - Computationally expensive for large datasets- Not suitable for large datasets due to memory constraints- Results can vary based on distance metric and linkage method | | DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) | Data with noise and outliers, arbitrary-shaped clusters | - Robust to noise and outliers- Can find clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes- No need to specify the number of clusters | - Sensitivity to the epsilon and minPts parameters- Not suitable for high-dimensional data- Difficulty handling clusters of varying densities | | Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) | Data with overlapping clusters, probabilistic cluster assignments | - Can capture complex cluster shapes and overlapping clusters- Provides probabilistic cluster assignments- Flexible in terms of cluster covariance | - Sensitive to initialization and local optima- Computationally expensive for large datasets and high-dimensional data- May converge to poor solutions for small datasets | | Spectral Clustering | Non-linear data, graph-based data, clusters with arbitrary shapes | - Can find clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes- Effective for non-linearly separable data- Robust to noise and outliers | - Requires tuning of parameters such as the number of clusters and affinity matrix- Computationally expensive for large datasets- Difficulty handling large number of clusters |\n Figure 4.2 : Confusion Matrix \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity and Overlap: The visualization shows both diversity and overlap among clusters. Clusters 1, 3, and 4 show more specific grouping characteristics that might correspond to unique news themes or linguistic styles, while Cluster 0 and 2 indicate broader or more common themes.\nPrincipal Components as Features: The PCA components are likely capturing underlying patterns in the usage of language across different news titles, which could be reflective of topic prevalence, sentiment, stylistic elements, or other latent features.\nUsefulness for Further Analysis: This kind of visualization is particularly useful for understanding how well the PCA and clustering algorithm have managed to discern and categorize the inherent structures in the data. It helps in deciding if further tuning is necessary, whether additional features should be considered, or if a different number of clusters might be more appropriate.",
